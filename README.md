# Order Valuation & Profitability Analysis


## Problem Statement

A business handling multiple orders across different regions needed real-time insights into its order valuation and profitability. The lack of visibility into orders at various stages (in progress, awaiting shipment, and being delivered) made it difficult to track revenue, optimize logistics, and improve regional performance. Additionally, understanding profit per product and region was essential for strategic decision-making.
